# Pandas_GUI
# Abstract
### This project is designed to assist non-technical users in decision-making through data analysis by providing intuitive visualizations such as time series diagrams, bar charts, data summaries, and automatic text summaries. Developed in Python, the project utilizes key libraries including pandas, tkinter, canvas, matplotlib, multiprocessing, and pickle. The process begins with analyzing the dataset according to specific requirements or significant patterns, followed by the generation of relevant charts. These visualizations are then integrated into a desktop graphical user interface (GUI). The final product enables users to access and interact with various charts through a single click, allowing for easy navigation and detailed examination of the data. Additionally, users can generate summaries of the chart content with a single click, enhancing their ability to make informed decisions.
